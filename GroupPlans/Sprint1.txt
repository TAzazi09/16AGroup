Group 16A - Sprint 1 Plan

Ethan - I will be creating most of the background code that communicates with the database. This includes the validation used by the 
registration interface to ensure the details the patient provides are valid for the databse to use. I will also create all SQL 
statements that are used by the application to communicate with the database. This includes the satemetns that create both the 
database and tables in GeneralPage, as well as statements that send and retrieve required data.

Nikola:
    - Login page GUI - username and password fields and a functional log-in button (send info to LoginCheck.java)
    - GeneralPage GUI - a 'Hello' message and two buttons, the left button sends back to the login page, and the right button sends to 
        the register page
    - Adding more checks for the registration checks (both in the Registration_gui.java and in the Registration.java)
    - Code quality control - This includes adding author comments at the top of the different files and monitoring what everyone has done,
        enforcing variable declarations to be in the beginning of the code, removing unnecessary auto-generated comments and adding useful
        ones (to every relatively complex and importnt method and code segments), imposing basic indenting and whitespace practices, and
        implementing proper project structure (e.g. having a separate folder for the functional files and a separate folder for the GUIs)
    - Coherency between the different pages of our app/website - consistent font (including font size), color theme (white and a specific
        shade of blue), spacing, and sime sized windows

    Test cases (learn how to do it and then do it)
    - for registration
	I will be testing inputs against desired outcomes, will check that details are tested correctly against registration creating 
	test cases with JUNIT 5. Age will be checked to see if they accept the correct age: Cannot be under 18 and over 120. Phone number 
	follows correct format and only one is accepted. First name and surname must also not exceed 15 characters. Lastly, details 
	shouldn't exceed 100 chracters
    - for log in Will

Kristian:
    I will be .creating the registration UI and making sure that it inserts new information into the database, i will be doing
    test cases for making sure that no duplicate information is inserted and correct format is also followed with proper error messages
    I will also make a general UI to allow the patient to select wether to login or register and make the corrosponding buttons to open the
    correct UI.

    - more test cases

Database Design:
The database is a simple one table design, where the table holds the details of registered patients. The details included a patientID that
auto increments as more details are added (first patient to register is 1, second is 2, etc). Other details are First Name, Surname, Age, 
Gender, DoctorChosen, Phone Number, Details. The only fields that allow null values are Phone Number and Details, since there is a
chance that the patient doesn't have access to a phone and would need to communicate with the doctors in a different way. No details may be
needed as well. The database is initialised when the app is launched, and won't be reset unless GeneralPage is directly opened again.
