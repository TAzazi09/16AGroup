Group 16A - Plan

Ethan - I will be creating the majority of the background code that communicates with the database. I also create sql statements that 
are used to create and communicate with the database.

Nikola:
    - Login page GUI
        - username and password fields
        - a functional log-in button (send info to LoginCheck.java)
    - GeneralPage GUI
        - a 'Hello' message and two buttons
            - the left button sends to the login page
            - the right button sends to the register page
    - Code quality control
        - author comments at the top of the different files
        - enforce variable declarations to be in the beginning of the code
        - comment monitoring (removing unnecessary auto-generated comments and adding useful ones)
        - impose basic indenting and whitespace practices
        - implement proper project structure (sql files in one folder, views in another, etc.)
    - Coherency between the different pages of our app/website
        - consistent font (including font size)
        - consistent color theme (white and a specific shade of blue)

        I will create the login page GUI. There are going to be two text fields, one for username and one for password. The view will also
    have two labels to show which text field is for what. Finally, there will be a log-in button that will send the user's info to our
    database for check. Iam going to use NetBeans' drag-and-drop tool to create the interface and it will generate the java swing code
    for me. Then I will manually add the button functionality to extract and send the necessary info to LoginCheck.java.
        I will also create the general page GUI. There are going to be two buttons, one that sends the user to the login page and one 
    that sends him to the register page. The view will also include a greeting label. I am going to use NetBeans' drag-and-drop tool to 
    generate the majority of the code, again, and then will fine tune it manually to remove redundant comments and lines of code, add 
    useful comments, play with the spacing, and do some basic code reformatting (like moving the variable declaration to the top).

    Test cases (learn how to do it and then do it)
    - for log in
    - for registration

Kristian:
    I will be .creating the registration UI and making sure that it inserts new information into the database, i will be doing
    test cases for making sure that no duplicate information is inserted and correct format is also followed with proper error messages
    I will also make a general UI to allow the patient to select wether to login or register and make the corrosponding buttons to open the
    correct UI.
